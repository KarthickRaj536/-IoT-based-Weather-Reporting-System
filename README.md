# IoT-based-Weather-Reporting-System

# Description
The IoT-Based Weather Reporting System using Raspberry Pi is a project designed to monitor and report real-time weather conditions through a network of interconnected sensors. The project leverages the capabilities of Raspberry Pi, sensors, and cloud connectivity to gather, process, and share weather data, providing users with accurate and up-to-date information. 
The main objectives of the weather reporting system are as follows:
1. To design a system that collects data about weather in real time and is highly reliable and accurate.
2. To develop an alerting system using some threshold values for different weather parameters.
3. To develop a report that is useful in sports for athletes, coaches, and spectators. With this project, real-time weather data can be gathered and analyzed to provide valuable insights for various outdoor sports activities.
